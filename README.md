# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. You can choose to play against a computer-controlled opponent (BOT) or against another player (PVP). The game is played in the console without any graphical interface.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file using Python.
2. Choose the game mode by entering 'BOT' or 'PVP' when prompted.
3. The game will display an empty 3x3 grid.
4. Player 1 will be assigned the 'X' symbol, and Player 2 (or the BOT) will be assigned the 'O' symbol.
5. Players take turns entering the row and column numbers to place their symbols on the grid. If playing against the BOT, you only need to enter the row and column numbers for your moves.
6. The game will check for a winner after each move. If a player has three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.
7. If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
